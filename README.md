# Overview

This is the first project I ever used Flutter and Dart in. This code was created as a part of the course "Learn Flutter and Dart: Complete App Development Projects" that I took on StackSkills. The functionality of the calculator is quite basic, but it was the user interface that took the most amount of effort. 

# Skills
Primarily Flutter and Dart. The code for this project was made in Android Studio and used the Android and iOS emulators provided by the technology in order to test it.
